#  WhatsApp Bot for Covid-19 vaccine notifications 

1. WhatsApp bot that **notifies people whenever there are vaccine slots available** in their locality for their age group. 
2. People can **easily subscribe to notifications** by filling up a google form, indicating their WhatsApp number, age group, and nearby pincodes.
3. The notification bot was helpful since vaccine slots for **18+ age group were rare** and one had to keep an eye on the official booking page all the time. 
4. **1000+ people** subscribed and a lot of them were able to book slot right after being notified by the bot.
